			<p align="center">Hello! My name is Milan K. Jethwa, I'm 23 years old and I'm a native Tanzanian. I have several years of experience coding Front-End and Back-End using different languages, such as HTML/CSS, C#, C++ and Python. I gathered interest in programming when I began high school. I was on the Computer Science track, which meant I was taking programming courses daily through the period I was enrolled. During the three years I was a high school student, I've learned App Inventor for Andriod, C# and Java, documenting my weekly assignments each semester on Google Sites. I wasn't sure what I could do with a career with Computer Science at the time, but I knew I was excited to see something I created in real time. I was eager to learn new concepts and develop more dynamic projects with these new technologies. I was encouraged to seek out Hackathons during my Junior year by my Java teacher, and I was able to win first place with my team at my second one a few months later! From there on, I knew I wanted to pursue Computer Programming professionally.
			<br><br>I'm currently attending University of Dar-es-Salaam, obtaining Computer Science degree.</p>
